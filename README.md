# NeuroDigit
NeuroDigit is a handwritten digit classification project built with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras.
The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and is capable of recognizing and classifying scanned images of handwritten digits with high accuracy.

The images are first normalized and reshaped to meet CNN input requirements, then processed through layers like convolution, max pooling, and dense layers with dropout to prevent overfitting. 

The model achieves over 99% validation accuracy and is evaluated using tools such as confusion matrices and classification reports. Additionally, an interactive module allows users to enter an image index and receive a real-time prediction, demonstrating the practical application of the model.
